This is my attempt at creating an online Boxing Drill Buddy Called Double Hook

Made with React JS and Material UI for now.

Designed in Figma at: https://www.figma.com/file/HVgpkGvQSoZtD5ioTLEgsN/DoubleHook?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=RerXlizy2sZyw3XY-1

This app is to help train people to be spontaneous with boxing strikes.

In later version I will add support for additional drills like Cover Counters, Counter Combos, Defense, and other things ive learned from my 2 years of doing Muay Thai

Just wanted to create a app I could actually use for myself when training by myself.

Others felt weird or looked weird.

First Version is Trash but Ill be building upon it over time.

Hope it doesnt suck lol
